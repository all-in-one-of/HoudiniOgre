</div>

<div id="body" class="tab">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="tabContent">
        
<p>The <b>HoudiniOgre</b> custom render operator exports
polygonal geometry and skeletal animation in a format native to
version 1.4 (Eihort) of the popular open-source graphics engine, <a
href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">OGRE</a>.</p>

<p>It is important to note that HoudiniOgre is purely a geometry
exporter (as opposed to a scene exporter). Specifically, no support is
currently provided for cameras, animation channels, or even materials.
Usage questions from non-commercial users are best addressed in the <a
href="http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/index.php">Ogre Forums</a>.  </p>

<p>HoudiniOgre was written by Ogre project lead Steve Streeting under
contract to <a href="http://www.edmstudio.com/">EDM Studio Inc.</a>, a
Canadian company that creates large-scale digital interactives for
leading museums, institutions and industry.  Creation of this tool
would not have occurred without the generous support of the fine folks
at <a href="http://www.sidefx.com">Side Effects Software</a>.</p>

<p>Commercial use of this product requires a paid license from EDM
Studio Inc; see terms of use for details.</p>

<h2>Mesh Export</h2>
<div class="tabContent">

<p>When exporting geometry with the custom exporter, keep the
following in mind: 

<ul>

<li>HoudiniOgre will export all Geometry objects whose display flag
(the blue one) is active.  If you want fine-grained control over what
gets exported, you can use groups to toggle visibility (and hence
export).</li>

<li>You must select an output path before hitting "Render".  Failure
to do so will cause the HoudiniOgre ROP to turn red.  Middle mouse on
the red icon to see the message.</li>

<li>While the exporter will triangulate all polygons, you are better
doing this within Houdini via the Divide SOP.  Doing so allows you to
see and judge the results before they get to Ogre.</li>

<li>The current version only descends into Geometry objects from /obj
level.  As a result, geometry contained within Houdini Digital Assets
(HDAs) is overlooked.  The workaround is to create a dummy Geometry
object that simply contains an ObjectMerge SOP referencing the HDA
geometry.  If this sounds like gibberish, you probably don't need this
functionality ;-)</li>

<li>Problems with exporting take on two forms.  
<ol> 

<li>A .mesh file is created but the results are incorrect when viewed
in your Ogre application (improperly lit, seemingly front-face culled,
incorrect texturing, etc.)  In this scenario, please verify that your
Ogre code is working correctly before attributing the problem to
HoudiniOgre.  Do a drop-in replacement with one of the standard Ogre
meshes to validate your code.</li>

<li>The red error flag appears (usually an output path issue, see
above) and/or Houdini crashes after pressing "Render".  Bad.  You've
almost certainly triggered a bug.  Restart Houdini, delete the
Ogre.log file in your Houdini installation directory, and ensure that
the problem still exists (Houdini is a complex piece of software and
ocassionally gets a corrupted internal state).  Try and pare your
.hipnc down to the smallest example that reliably recreates the crash.
Send this and the Ogre.log file to houdiniogre@edmstudio.com for
possible debugging.</li>
</ol>

HoudiniOgre is first and foremost an internal EDM Studio tool.  We
rapidly respond to bugs that affect our workflow and our commercial
licensees.  As a non-commercial user, please don't expect the same
level of service as a paying customer.</li>

<h2>Skeletal Animation</h2>
<div class="tabContent">

<p>Exporting of bone-driven animation cycles to Ogre is handled as
follows: 
<ol> 

<li>Create a standard Houdini polygonal character rig.  Feel free to
use IK, FK, path-driven kinematics as HoudiniOgre will simply sample
bone positions at the designated rate.</li>

<li>Keyframe your various animation cycles at different ranges on the
timeline.  For example, frames 1-100 as a walk cycle, frames 101-259
as a "fall down" cycle, etc.</li>

<li>To indicate these various cycles to the exporter, we make use of
so-called "detail attributes".  Whereas custom point and primitive
attributes are replicated per point or per primitive, detail
attributes occur once per object.  At each frame of a given cycle, use
the AttribCreate SOP to add a string detail attribute "animcycle" with
a value equal to your desired cycle name.  The exporter will form an
Ogre AnimationState for each sequence of Houdini frames having a
similarly-named "animcycle" detail attribute.  (Yes, we know this is
an inconvenient method of specifying the animation cycle.  EDM Studio
is looking at a more convenient method for specifying these
ranges.)</li>

<li>Add a HoudiniOgre ROP.  Set the sample rate to the desired
temporal resolution (default is 5 samples/second). Render.  The
exporter will create a .mesh file for your character geometry and an
associated .skel file containing the bone definitions and animation
cycle information.</li>

When rendering a range of frames, adding a $F to the Output Path (see below) will yield a sequence of unique output files.  For example, with frame range 1-10, an Output Path of "$HIP/object$F3" will create a sequence of files, "$HIP/object001.mesh", "$HIP/object002.mesh", ... "$HIP/object010.mesh".  As vertex animation is not currently supported, use this method to export snapshots of a deforming mesh.
